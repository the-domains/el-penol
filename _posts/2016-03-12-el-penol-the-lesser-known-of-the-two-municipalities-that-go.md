El Peñol. The lesser known of the two municipalities that govern the area around the lake, yet El Peñol has three times more inhabitants than Guatape. Probably because the town of El Peñol does not have any lake access whereas Guatape has the lake as a border on it's Western side. The "malecon" (promenade) runs along the lake front for more than a kilometre, is a popular place to take a walk and enjoy the lake.

The present day El Peñol was formed in the 70s when a dam was built to provide hydro electricity, the old El Peñol was flooded and a new small town was built a little higher up the mountains. The only house remaining from the original El Peñol is now a museum dedicated to the history of El Peñol and the surrounding area. The site of the old church is marked by a cross standing forlornly in the water, there is a small 2/3 sized replica of old Penol situated 2 km outside the town in the direction of Guatape. Here there are tourist shops, boat trips, an outdoor theatre and within site of the replica is the hotel Lago de mis sueños near but far enough away that guests are not disturbed by the tourists visiting the replica of El Peñol.
